	I came to Japan at the beginning of the year 2000, and I have lived in Japan ever since then. I felt happy to be in here, especially for a Chinese. I found a lot of similarities between these two closely related cultures, e.g., I can read almost everything here, though some of the time, I don't know how to pronounce the Japanese characters. Like "”" (visible only if you choose the encoding to be Japanese compatible), actually it is pronounced as "kashiwa" and I knew it from long ago, but just give an idea of how a Japanese Character is recognizable Chinese. :)  </font></p>

	Recently, I started blearing cooking. Yes, as a totally personal hobby, I forget my work and other stuffs when making the food! You can find later some photos of my work. Basically, I like making Chinese food, since	it is my native and I do know a lot. However, I've also found some Italian and Japanese dishes easy -- sure, this needs some sense, but I believe, I am not the least.
